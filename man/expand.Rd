\title{expand does the expansion from a fitted object}
\usage{
expand(
  fit,
  coverage = NULL,
  control = list(sigfig_multiplier = 100, mcmc_samples = 1000, maxX = 20000)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{the estimated bycatch rate from a call to fit}

\item{coverage}{the coverage rate (0-100). This can be a scalar if all values are the same, or a vector corresponding to each row of the data frame used in fitting}

\item{control}{list of 3 elements used for control: sigfig_multiplier (used for adjusting precision of estimates, defaults to 1000), mcmc_samples (number of mcmc samples randomly selected from the posterior for expansion), maxX (upper bound for drawing from latent bycatch events, also related to sigfig_multiplier)}
}
\value{
expanded_estimates the estimates of expanded estimates across rows of the dataframe and mcmc samples
}
